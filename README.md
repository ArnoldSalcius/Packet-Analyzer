# Packet-Analyzer

This project was part of Networking class at FAU. Goal of this project is to take packets from an existing database which I populated with packets that were provided.
Program then takes the packets and creates another table in the database storing each unique IP adress, amount of packets sent, transmission duration and type of probing (if its a probe).
